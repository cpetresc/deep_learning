# Building and Evaluating Neural Networks for MNIST

## Overview 
This project focuses on building, training, and evaluating several neural network architectures on the MNIST dataset of handwritten digits using PyTorch.
The goal is to compare the performance of different architectures, from a simple single hidden layer to a convolutional neural network (CNN), and analyze their accuracy and learning behavior.
